        "LangChain is designed to assist developers in building end-to-end applications using language models. It offers an array of tools, components, and interfaces that simplify the process of creating applications powered by large language models and chat models. LangChain streamlines managing interactions with LLMs, chaining together multiple components, and integrating additional resources, such as APIs and databases. Having gained a foundational understanding of the library in previous lesson, let's now explore various examples of utilizing prompts to accomplish multiple tasks."

In LangChain, message prompt templates are used to construct and work with prompts, allowing us to exploit the underlying chat model's potential fully.\n",

        "System and Human prompts differ in their roles and purposes when interacting with chat models. SystemMessagePromptTemplate provides initial instructions, context, or data for the AI model, while HumanMessagePromptTemplate are messages from the user that the AI model responds to."
