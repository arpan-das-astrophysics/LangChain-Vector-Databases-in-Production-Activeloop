For creative tasks, a temperature between 0.70 and 0.90 offers a balance of reliability and creativity. The best setting should be determined by experimenting with different values for each specific use case. The code initializes the GPT-3 model’s Davinci variant. We will learn more about the various models and their differences later on."
